# CVE_DataMining_Research
Programs and Data used in CVE Data Mining Research (University of Virginia)

# Build

Run `cmake .` and `make` in the current directory. The executable file will be named "Stats".

So far, the compilation and execution have been tested on Fedora 23 and Ubuntu 14.04 (subsystem of Windows 10).
It will not run on Windows without modification, because the directories are coded in Unix convention.  

You need cmake of at least version 2.6 to deploy the project.
