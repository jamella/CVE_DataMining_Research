Reason: this candidate was originally recorded for a \"SPLAT Remote Root Exploit\" that was claimed to exist for Check Point SmartCenter.  The claim has no actionable details and was disclosed by a person of unknown reliability who did not coordinate with the vendor.  No people of known reliability have confirmed the original claim.  The vendor has not indicated that they are aware of any vulnerability.  Since the claim has no actionable details or independent verification, it is outside the scope of CVE according to current inclusion criteria."
